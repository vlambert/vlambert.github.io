<h4>Relationship Between Fault Zone Physics and Earthquake Source Properties</h4>
<!--        <div class="left">-->
	  
        <p>Recent observations of subduction zone earthquakes have highlighted unexpected characteristics in the seismic source process. One potentially insightful phenomenon is that earthquakes occuring at different depths have been shown to contain different frequency contents as judged by their radiated energies (Ye et al., JGR 2016). In particular, seismic observations from several recent great earthquakes - the 2004 Mw 9.2 Sumatra-Andaman, 2010 Mw  8.8 Chile, and 2011 Mw  9.0 Tohoku-Oki events - suggest that more of the high-frequency radiation from the rupture process originated from the deeper extensions of the megathrust (e.g., Meng et al., GRL 2011; Lay et al., JGR 2012; Yao et al., GJI 2012) while the greatest amount of slip occured in the shallower regions</p>

<p> The underlying physical mechanisms contributing to these observations remain an open question. Are these observations the result of increased frictional heterogeneity along the megathrust or the systematic variation of basic physical properties with depth (e.g. confining stress, pore pressure, frictional properties)? We aim to explore physical explanations for the enhancement of high-frequency radiation at depth, as well as other relevant findings such as the presence of slow slip events and tremor, through the development of numerical simulations of earthquake source processes, including both dynamic events and slow aseismic slip. By combining insight from geophysical observations and physics-based modeling of dynamic earthquake sequences, we aim to constrain details of the seismic source process and potential models of fault zone properties.</p>

            <h4>Global High-Frequency Earthquake Source Imaging</h4>
<!--            <div class="left">-->
            <p>The general characterization of earthquake source processes at long periods has seen great success via seismic finite fault inversion/modeling. Complementary techniques, such as seismic back-projection, extend the capabilities of source imaging to higher frequencies and reveal finer details of the rupture process. However, such high frequency methods are limited by the implicit assumption of simple Green’s functions, which restricts the use of global arrays and introduces artifacts (e.g., sweeping effects, depth/water phases) that require careful attention. This motivates the implementation of an imaging technique that considers the potential complexity of Green’s functions at high frequencies. We propose an alternative inversion approach based on the modest assumption that the path effects contributing to signals within high-coherency subarrays share a similar form. Under this assumption, we develop a method that can combine multiple high-coherency subarrays to invert for a sparse set of subevents. By accounting for potential variability in the Green’s functions among subarrays, our method allows for the utilization of heterogeneous global networks for robust high resolution imaging of the complex rupture process. The approach also provides a consistent framework for examining frequency-dependent radiation across a broad frequency spectrum.</p>

		  <p> The use of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) for detecting various transient strain signals is becoming more popular within the scientific community. We are interested in exploring the potential applications of DAS in seismology and other fields of geophysical observation. The Goldstone Optical Fiber Seismic experiment (GOLFS) is a collaborative experiment with teams at Caltech, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In the Fall of 2017, we deployed three broadband seismometers and began testing DAS measurements using the existing DSN fibers at the Goldstone Deep Space Communication Network. 
		  </p>
		  <p position="relative"> Recently there has been the establishment of the Pasadena DAS array run by Caltech, making use of cables running throughout the city of Pasadena. This system explores the sensitivity of the network to seismicity and various sources of noise within the surrounding neighborhoods. The Caltech group has also been making use of the Millikan Library roof shaker to excite the resonant modes of the building as a controlled active source.

<!--<h4>Modeling Earthquake Sequences within the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere System</h4>-->
<div class="left">
  <p> Fault slip relaxes lithospheric stress imposed by mantle flow, and in turn transfers stress to the ductile regions. The interplay of these systems governs the style of deformation at plate boundaries including the recurrence of seismic events. However, such deep processes remain challenging to incorporate in numerical simulations of earthquake cycles. We have developed a framework that couples fault slip and viscoelastic deformation to simulate fault dynamics in the lithosphere-asthenosphere system. The method resolves all phases of the earthquake cycle, including rupture propagation, afterslip, slow-slip events and the modulation of strain rate incurred in the ductile regions. Transient accelerations in the asthenosphere may follow both earthquakes and slow-slip events shortly after the rupture, depending on the rheology of the upper mantle and the magnitude of the event. We hope to gain greater insight into the variability of earthquake sequences by incorporating the dynamics of distributed deformation. </p>
  
  <p><b>Movie:</b> The video shows simulated time series for the evolution of surface deformation (top), slip velocity (middle) and strain rate (bottom) over 400 years for a system with two vertical strike-slip faults embedded in an elastic layer overlaying a viscoelastic asthenosphere governed by power-law dislocation creep. We show the spatial cross-section of slip velocity on the two faults and strain rate within the viscoelastic bulk throughout the time series, as well as the corresponding surface displacement in the along-strike direction. The two faults have different seismogenic regions with the East Fault being able to host larger earthquakes than the West Fault. The green lines in the top and bottom panels reference the locations of the two faults and the contours in the middle and bottom panels denote the cumulative inelastic deformation in strain.</p>
