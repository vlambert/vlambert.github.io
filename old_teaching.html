	      <b>Ph 5/105: Analog Electronics Laboratory</b>, Caltech, Instructor: Ken Libbrecht, Frank Rice, Fall 2012 <br>
 A fast-paced laboratory course covering the design, construction, and testing of practical analog and interface circuits, with emphasis on applications of operational amplifiers. No prior experience with electronics is required. Basic linear and nonlinear elements and circuits are studied, including amplifiers, filters, oscillators and other signal conditioning circuits. Each week includes a 45 minute lecture/recitation and a 2½ hour laboratory. The course culminates in a two-week project of the student’s choosing.<br>

            <p><h4>Community Engagement</h4>
	      I enjoy taking up opportunities to discuss science and educational methodologies with community members of all ages. At Caltech, I have found great pleasure in discussing teaching pedaogy with the  <a href="https://www.ctlo.caltech.edu/">Center for Teaching, Learning and Outreach</a>, as well as participating in community events such as the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/caltech-science-for-march-tickets-42728355662">Caltech Science for March</a>. Outside of the Pasadena area, I have been involved with a variety of programs involving the broader global community such as the American Physical Society's <a href="https://www.adoptaphysicist.org/webdocs/about.cfm">Adopt-a-Physicist</a> program, moderating the  <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/content/cms-physics-masterclass">International Physics Masterclasses</a> hosted by CERN and the ETH Z&uumlrich, as well as providing <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/org/visits-cms">research facility tours at CERN and the Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment</a><br>
<br>
One of my greatest interests is in helping young scientists find opportunities to get involved with research and explore potential scientific and career interests early on in their educational endeavors. Since finishing my own undergraduate degree I have tried to support some of the programs around me such as the  <a href="http://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/surf">Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow (SURF)</a> and <a href="http://diversitycenter.caltech.edu/programs/fsri">Freshman Summer Research Institute (FSRI)</a> programs, both as a research mentor for students, as well as routinely serving as a convener and judge for the student research seminars. <br>
<br>
I am always interested in learning of more ways to get involved with sharing science with the broader community. Please feel free to message me with any suggestions or requests.<br>
