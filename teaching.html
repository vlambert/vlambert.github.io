<!--            <p><h4>Education in STEM and Opportunities for Undergraduate Research</h4>
	      
	      I very much enjoy opportunities to discuss different areas of scientific research and educational methodologies. At Caltech, I have found great pleasure in discussing teaching pedagogy and methods for improving STEM education with the  <a href="https://www.ctlo.caltech.edu/">Center for Teaching, Learning and Outreach</a>, as well as methods for developing inclusive learning and working environments, and promoting  advocacy and allyship with the <a href="https://diversity.caltech.edu/">Center for Diversity</a>. 
<br>
One of my greatest interests is in helping other young scientists find opportunities to get involved with research and explore potential scientific and career interests early on in their educational endeavors. I have tried to support a number of programs around me that help high school and undergraduate students learn about science and different career paths, as well as find mentors and perform research, such as the <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/content/cms-physics-masterclass">CERN International Physical Masterclasses</a>, <a href="https://www.adoptaphysicist.org/">Adopt-a-Physicist</a>, <a href="http://sfp.caltech.edu/programs/surf">Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow (SURF)</a> and <a href="http://diversitycenter.caltech.edu/programs/fsri">Freshman Summer Research Institute (FSRI).</a> <br>
<!--<br>
I am always interested in discussing different scientific avenues with aspiring researchers, including assisting students in finding research mentors, at Caltech and other institutes,  and potentially developing a research project together. I welcome any questions and try my best to respond to emails promptly. <br> -->
